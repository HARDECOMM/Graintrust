## 🔄 The "Golden Path" Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: The Farmer (Field to Market)
1. **Scan Field**: Farmer uploads a photo of their rice field to `/api/grains/scan-field`. AI returns a yield prediction (e.g., 15 tons).
2. **Visualize**: Farmer calls `/api/grains/visualize` with their field photo. AI generates a professional photo of the grains.
3. **List**: Farmer calls `POST /api/grains` combining the yield data and the AI image to create a listing.

### Phase 2: The Mill (Purchase & Escrow)
4. **Fund**: A Mill finds the listing and calls `/api/escrow/fund/:id`. Money is secured via Interswitch.
5. **Verify**: Upon delivery, the Mill calls `/api/escrow/verify/:id` with a photo of the actual grains. AI confirms quality.
6. **Disburse**: Once verified, the Mill calls `/api/escrow/disburse/:id`. Funds are moved to the Farmer's account.

## 🛡 Security & Validation
- **RBAC**: Only `farmer` roles can list grains; only `mill` roles can fund/verify escrows.
- **AI Integrity**: Every transaction is backed by verifiable AI analysis data stored in the database.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting for AI quotas, auth failures, and invalid state transitions.
